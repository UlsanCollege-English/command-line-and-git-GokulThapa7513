        <p>Cyber security is the application of technologies, processes,
           and controls<br> to protect systems, networks, programs, devices and data from cyber attacks.
  
          <p>It aims to reduce the risk of cyber attacks and protect against the unauthorised<br> exploitation of systems, networks, and technologies.</p>

      <h2 class="Importance-heading">Why is cyber security important?</h2>
      <div class="Importance-content-container">
        <div class="Importance-content">
          <h3>	&#8594; The costs of cyber security breaches are rising.</h3>
          <p>Organisations that suffer cyber security breaches may face significant fines. 
             There are also non-financial costs to be considered, like reputational damage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Importance-content">
          <h3>	&#8594; Cyber attacks are increasingly sophisticated.</h3>
          <p>Cyber attacks continue to grow in sophistication, with attackers using an ever-expanding variety of tactics.
             These include social engineering, malware and ransomware.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Importance-content">
          <h3>	&#8594; Cyber security is a critical, board-level issue.</h3>
          <p>New regulations and reporting requirements make cyber security risk oversight a challenge.
             The board needs assurance from management that its cyber risk strategies will reduce
             the risk of attacks and limit financial and operational impacts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Importance-content">
          <h3>	&#8594; Cyber crime is a big business.</h3>
          <p>According to a study by McAfee and the CSIS, based on data collected by Vanson Bourne,
             the world economy loses more than $1 trillion each year due to cybercrime. Political, ethical,
             and social incentives can also drive attackers.</p>
